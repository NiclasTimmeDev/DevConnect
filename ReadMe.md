## How to get started

In the root folder as well as in the client folder, run:<br>
<code>npm install</code>

In config/default.json make sure that you replace mongoURI and githubKeys with your own ones.

Server and client run with concurrently. By default, the server will run on Port 5000 & the Frontend will run on Port 3000.
To start things of, in the root directory, run:<br>
<code>npm run dev</code>
